# House Cost Prediction

This repository contains a project that predicts house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms using multiple linear regression.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for house prices using multiple linear regression. The dataset used in this project includes features like square footage of living area, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and number of floors.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `mul_predictive_analysis.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- `price`: The price of the house.
- `sqft_living`: Square footage of the living area.
- `bedrooms`: Number of bedrooms.
- `bathrooms`: Number of bathrooms.
- `floors`: Number of floors.

## Files in the Repository

- `House_Cost_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, model training, and predictions.
- `mul_predictive_analysis.csv`: The dataset used for training the model.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- statsmodels
- scipy
- matplotlib

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas statsmodels scipy matplotlib
